""" 
Tuple stands for "filters, kernel_size, stride"
Every convolution is same convolution -> by adding padding you get the same output spatial size as the input
List is structured by "B" indicating a residual block followed by the number of repeats
"S" is for scale prediction block and computing the yolo loss
"U" is for upsampling the feature map and concatenating with a previous layer
